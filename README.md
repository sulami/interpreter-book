In this repo, I'm working through the second half of [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), the part that is about
compiling and running bytecode.

I'm using the book more as an inspiration than a guide, so not only am I working
in Rust instead of C (for learning purposes), but I am also implementing a
different grammar (for aesthetic purposes). I'm going to be building a Lisp,
assuming everything works out.

Note that this is my first ever Rust code, so it's probably terrible all-around.
